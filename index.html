                    Numerous university goers are weighed down with an abundance of required apps/sites, several of which often do the same job but the utilization of them all is still necessary do to professors having a preference for a certain site etc. Our platform seeks to remedy the issue by creating a domain thatâ€™s sole purpose is to integrate these various sites into one easily traversable space.

But also what we would need to do to make the concept a reality like webscrapping, API's and issues that may arise from that like TOS conflicts.
